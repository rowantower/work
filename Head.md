What should the page have in head tag apart of seo meta info?

<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=Edge;chrome=1"> - tells IE to show content in Edge mode, could be dropped
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> - for mobile view defaults
<meta charset="utf-8"> - for extra characters
